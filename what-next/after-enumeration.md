# 🗺️ What To Do After Enumeration

You've run the scans. You've checked every port. You've enumerated the web server, dug into DNS, checked SMB, analyzed the JavaScript files, and fuzzed the parameters. Now you have a list of findings. The question everyone asks at this point — what do I actually do with all of this?

This is where enumeration ends and exploitation begins.

## 🧠 The Mindset Shift

Enumeration is intelligence gathering. You've been building a picture of the target — what's there, how it's configured, what version it's running, what's accessible.

Now you shift from *"what is here?"* to *"what can I do with what I found?"*

Every finding from enumeration maps to a next action. Nothing you found is useless — even dead ends tell you something. Here's how to work through everything systematically.

## 🔄 The Post-Enumeration Flow
```
Enumeration finding
        ↓
Categorize — what type of finding is this?
        ↓
Research — what does this version/misconfiguration allow?
        ↓
Exploit or Escalate
        ↓
Document
```

## 🎯 Finding by Finding — What To Do Next

### You found an open port with an identified service version
```bash
# Research the version
searchsploit <service> <version>
# Visit: https://exploit-db.com
# Visit: https://nvd.nist.gov
# Google: "<service> <version> CVE"
```

Every version number is a potential CVE. Copy the exact version string nmap gave you and search it. If a public exploit exists — read it carefully before running it.

### You found a web login page

- Try default credentials first — always
- Common defaults: `admin/admin`, `admin/password`, `root/root`, `guest/guest`
- Check if the login page leaks the technology — "Powered by WordPress" means try `admin/admin` on `/wp-login.php`
- Test for SQL injection: enter `' OR '1'='1` in the username field
- Check the page source for hints, hidden fields, commented-out credentials

---

### You found a directory listing (`/backup`, `/files`, `/uploads`)

- Download everything accessible
- Look for: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.sql`, `.bak`, `.config`, `.env`, `.key`
- Any database backup is extremely high value — often contains credentials
- Any `.env` file almost certainly contains credentials
- Any SSH key files — use them immediately
```bash
# Download everything recursively
wget -r http://<target>/backup/
```

---

### You found an exposed `.git` directory
```bash
# Dump the entire repository
git-dumper http://<target>/.git/ ./dumped-repo

# Search the history for credentials
cd dumped-repo
git log --oneline
git log -p | grep -iE "(password|secret|key|token)"
```

---

### You found valid SMB shares
```bash
# Connect and download everything
smbclient //<target>/ShareName -N
smb: \> mget *

# Search downloaded files for credentials
grep -rE "(password|passwd|secret|key)" ./downloaded-files/
```

---

### You found valid usernames

Build a username list and test credentials across every service:
```bash
# Create username file
echo "jsmith" >> users.txt
echo "admin" >> users.txt
echo "john.smith" >> users.txt

# Password spray SSH
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<target>

# Password spray SMB
netexec smb <target> -u users.txt -p 'Password123' --continue-on-success

# Check password policy first — avoid lockouts
enum4linux-ng -A <target> | grep -i "password policy"
```

---

### You found credentials

Test them everywhere — credential reuse is one of the most common paths to access:
```bash
# SSH
ssh username@<target>

# SMB
smbclient //<target>/C$ -U username

# FTP
ftp <target>

# Web login pages
# Try manually in browser

# Database
mysql -u username -p -h <target>
```

---

### You found a subdomain or vhost
```bash
# Add to /etc/hosts
echo "<ip> subdomain.example.com" >> /etc/hosts

# Enumerate it like a fresh target
gobuster dir -u http://subdomain.example.com \
  -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt \
  -x php,html,txt \
  -t 50
```

---

### You found SNMP with default community string
```bash
# Full walk — save everything
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <target> > snmp-full.txt

# Search for credentials in process list
grep -iE "(password|passwd|secret)" snmp-full.txt

# Get user list for password spraying
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <target> 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25
```

---

### You found an API endpoint
```bash
# Test for unauthenticated access
curl -s http://<target>/api/v1/users
curl -s http://<target>/api/v1/admin

# Fuzz for parameters
arjun -u http://<target>/api/v1/users

# Test for IDOR — change IDs
curl -s http://<target>/api/v1/users/1
curl -s http://<target>/api/v1/users/2

# Test JWT if present
jwt_tool <token>
```

## 📋 Prioritization — What to Try First

Not all findings are equal. Here's how to prioritize:

| Priority | Finding | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | Default credentials that work | Immediate access |
| 🔴 Critical | Public exploit for identified version | Direct path to RCE |
| 🔴 Critical | Credentials found in files | Try everywhere |
| 🟠 High | SQL injection on login form | Authentication bypass |
| 🟠 High | Exposed `.env` or config files | Credential extraction |
| 🟠 High | Accessible SMB shares | File access, credential hunting |
| 🟡 Medium | Username list | Enables credential attacks |
| 🟡 Medium | Old software versions | Research required |
| 🟢 Low | Technology stack identified | Informs attack direction |
