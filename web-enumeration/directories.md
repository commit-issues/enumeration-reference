# 📁 Directory & File Enumeration

You found a web server on port 80 or 443. You opened it in your browser and saw a homepage. Most beginners stop there. The homepage is not the attack surface — everything hidden behind it is.

## 🧠 What is Directory Busting?

Directory busting (also called directory enumeration or content discovery) is the process of systematically guessing file and folder paths on a web server to find things that aren't linked anywhere visible.

Web servers host files and folders. Some are meant to be public. Many are not — but they're still accessible if you know to ask for them. A wordlist-based tool sends thousands of requests, one per guess, and reports back what actually exists.

Think of it like trying every room number in a hotel. Most doors won't open. But some will — and behind them you might find a maintenance closet full of master keys, a conference room with sensitive documents left on the table, or a back exit nobody told you about.

## 📊 HTTP Response Codes — Know These Cold

When your tool sends a request to `/admin`, the server responds with a status code. That code tells you what happened.

| Code | Name | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `200` | OK | Page exists and loaded successfully | Investigate immediately |
| `301` | Moved Permanently | Content moved to a new URL — follow the redirect | Follow it |
| `302` | Found (Temporary Redirect) | Temporarily redirected | Follow it — often redirects to login |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Page exists but requires authentication | Note it — credentials needed |
| `403` | Forbidden | Page exists but you're not allowed | Note it — may be bypassable |
| `404` | Not Found | Page doesn't exist | Move on |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Server crashed on your request | Interesting — note it |

> 💡 **403 is not a dead end.** A 403 means the server knows the page is there and is actively blocking you. That's more useful than a 404. There are bypass techniques worth trying — different HTTP methods, path manipulation, header injection.

## 📂 Common Directories Worth Finding

These are the paths that consistently produce findings across CTF boxes and real engagements.

| Path | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `/admin` | Admin panel — often default credentials or unprotected |
| `/administrator` | Common CMS admin path (Joomla, etc.) |
| `/wp-admin` | WordPress admin panel |
| `/login` | Login page — check for default creds, SQLi |
| `/dashboard` | Internal dashboard — often unprotected |
| `/api` | API endpoint — check for unauthenticated access |
| `/api/v1` | Versioned API — try v1, v2, v3 |
| `/backup` | Backup files — goldmine for credentials and source code |
| `/backups` | Same |
| `/.git` | Exposed git repository — full source code disclosure |
| `/.env` | Environment file — often contains credentials and API keys |
| `/config` | Configuration files |
| `/uploads` | File upload directory — check for executable files |
| `/files` | Same |
| `/include` | PHP includes — sometimes directly accessible |
| `/phpmyadmin` | Database admin panel |
| `/robots.txt` | Explicitly lists paths the site wants hidden — always check |
| `/sitemap.xml` | Full map of site content |
| `/.htaccess` | Apache config — sometimes readable |

> 💡 **Always check `robots.txt` first.** It's a file that tells search engines what not to index — which means it's a list of things the site owner wants hidden. It's public and unprotected by design.

## 🔎 What To Do When You Find Something

**Found a `/admin` or `/login` page:**
- Try default credentials (admin/admin, admin/password, root/root)
- Check the page source for hints
- Run a targeted scan with Nikto
- Test for SQL injection on the login form

**Found a `/backup` or `/.git` directory:**
- Download everything you can
- `.git` repositories can be dumped with `git-dumper` to get full source code
- Backup files often contain database dumps, config files with credentials

**Found a `/.env` file:**
- Download it immediately
- It almost certainly contains database credentials, API keys, or secret tokens

**Found a `403 Forbidden`:**
- Try adding a trailing slash: `/admin/`
- Try different HTTP methods: `curl -X POST https://target.com/admin`
- Try path manipulation: `/admin/../admin/`
- Try headers: `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`

**Found a `/uploads` directory:**
- Check if you can access files directly
- If the site has a file upload function, this is where uploaded shells land
