A wordlist is only as good as what's in it. The right wordlist on the right target is the difference between finding the admin panel in 30 seconds and running a scan for 6 hours that finds nothing. This guide covers what wordlists are, where to get them safely, which ones to use for each scenario, and how to build your own.

## 🧠 What is a Wordlist — Plain English

A wordlist is a text file with one entry per line. Your enumeration tool reads the file, sends a request for each entry, and reports back what got a response.

For directory busting, each line is a path: `admin`, `login`, `backup`, `config`.
For subdomain enumeration, each line is a subdomain: `dev`, `staging`, `api`, `mail`.
For password attacks, each line is a password: `password123`, `Welcome1`, `Summer2024`.

The quality of your results depends entirely on the quality of your wordlist. A bad wordlist misses things. A good wordlist finds them.

## ⚠️ Security Warning — Where You Get Wordlists Matters

This is important and most guides skip it entirely.

Wordlists are text files — they can't directly harm you. But the sources you download them from can.

**Only download wordlists from:**
- SecLists (GitHub: danielmiessler/SecLists) — the gold standard, maintained by security professionals
- Official tool repositories (dirb, dirbuster, gobuster releases)
- Kali Linux built-in lists — pre-installed and vetted

**Never download wordlists from:**
- Random forum posts or Pastebin links
- Unofficial "super wordlist" collections from unknown sources
- Torrent files or file sharing sites
- Any source that requires you to disable antivirus or run a script to "extract" the list

A malicious actor could distribute a wordlist bundled with a script that phones home, exfiltrates data, or installs malware. Text files are safe. Zip archives with extraction scripts, installers, or anything that requires execution — are not.

**The rule:** If it's not on GitHub from a known security researcher or in your OS package manager — don't use it.

## 📂 SecLists Directory Structure

Once installed, here's where the important lists live:
```
SecLists/
├── Discovery/
│   ├── Web-Content/          ← directory and file enumeration
│   └── DNS/                  ← subdomain enumeration
├── Passwords/
│   ├── Common-Credentials/   ← common passwords
│   └── Leaked-Databases/     ← rockyou and others
├── Usernames/
│   └── Names/                ← username lists
├── Fuzzing/                  ← fuzzing payloads
└── Miscellaneous/            ← everything else
```

## 🎯 The Right List for the Right Job

### 🌐 Web Directory Enumeration

| List | Size | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt` | Small | Quick first pass |
| `Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt` | Medium | Standard CTF scan |
| `Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt` | Large | Thorough scan |
| `Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files.txt` | Medium | File discovery |
| `Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` | Medium | Classic dirbuster list |
| `Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt` | Medium | Parameter fuzzing |

**Quick start command:**
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x php,html,txt,bak -t 50
```

---

### 🌐 Subdomain Enumeration

| List | Size | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt` | Small | Fast first pass |
| `Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt` | Medium | Standard scan |
| `Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt` | Large | Thorough scan |
| `Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt` | Large | Alternative source |

**Quick start command:**
```bash
gobuster dns -d example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --show-ips
```

---

### 👤 Username Lists

| List | Best for |
|---|---|
| `Usernames/Names/names.txt` | General username enumeration |
| `Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt` | Quick check — most common usernames |
| `Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt` | Large scale enumeration |

---

### 🔑 Password Lists

| List | Best for |
|---|---|
| `Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt` | Quick password spray |
| `Passwords/Common-Credentials/100k-most-used-passwords-NCSC.txt` | Thorough spray |
| `Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz` | Full brute force |

> 💡 **rockyou.txt** is the most famous password list in cybersecurity — 14 million passwords leaked from the RockYou breach in 2009. It's the first list you try on any password cracking task in CTF. On Kali it lives at `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz` — extract it with `gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`.

## 🔨 Password Cracking — John the Ripper

When you find a hash — a scrambled version of a password — you need a cracking tool to recover the original password. John the Ripper is the standard.

> ⚠️ **Important note on versions:** The original `john` package in many package managers is outdated. You want **John the Ripper Jumbo** — the community-enhanced version with support for more hash types and better performance.

### Installation

**Linux (Kali — Jumbo version pre-installed):**
```bash
# Verify you have Jumbo
john --list=formats | grep -i jumbo

# If not installed
sudo apt install john
```

**macOS — Jumbo version:**
```bash
# Homebrew installs Jumbo by default
brew install john-jumbo

# Verify
john --list=formats | wc -l
# Should show 400+ formats if Jumbo is installed
# Original john only shows ~40 formats
```

**Windows:**
```
# Download Jumbo builds from:
https://www.openwall.com/john/

# Look for the Windows binaries package
# Extract and run john.exe from the run/ folder
```

### Common John Commands
```bash
# Crack with rockyou wordlist
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack SSH private key
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john id_rsa.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack zip file password
zip2john file.zip > zip.hash
john zip.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Show cracked passwords
john hash.txt --show

# List supported hash formats
john --list=formats

# Identify hash type first
john --list=formats | grep -i md5
```

## 🔧 Building Custom Wordlists with CeWL

CeWL (Custom Word List generator) crawls a website and builds a wordlist from the words it finds. This is useful because people often use words related to their organization as passwords and directory names.

### Installation

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install cewl
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install cewl
```

**Windows:**
Download from: https://github.com/digininja/CeWL

### Commands
```bash
# Basic crawl — generates wordlist from target site
cewl http://<target> -w custom-wordlist.txt

# Set crawl depth
cewl http://<target> -d 3 -w custom-wordlist.txt

# Set minimum word length
cewl http://<target> -m 6 -w custom-wordlist.txt

# Include email addresses found on site
cewl http://<target> --email -w custom-wordlist.txt

# Full recommended command
cewl http://<target> -d 3 -m 6 -w custom-wordlist.txt

# Use your custom list with gobuster
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w custom-wordlist.txt
```

> 💡 **When to use CeWL:** If you're enumerating a company's website before a real engagement — their product names, employee names, and industry terms are likely to appear as passwords and directory names. CeWL automates the collection of those terms.

## 📋 Built-in Kali Wordlists

Kali Linux comes with several wordlists pre-installed at `/usr/share/wordlists/`:
```bash
# List available wordlists
ls /usr/share/wordlists/

# Most important ones:
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz      # extract first with gunzip
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt     # quick directory scan
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt        # larger directory scan
/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/          # dirbuster lists
```

---

## 🔄 Recommended Wordlist Strategy
```bash
# Step 1 — quick scan with small list first
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 50

# Step 2 — if nothing interesting, move to medium SecLists
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -t 50

# Step 3 — add extensions based on what tech stack you identified
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x php,html,txt,bak -t 50

# Step 4 — if you have context about the target, use CeWL
cewl http://<target> -d 3 -m 6 -w custom.txt
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w custom.txt -t 50
```
